      <p class="lrgft"><span class="bigFancy">M</span>y name is Tristan Perera. I grew up as a middle child with two brothers.
        Tech has always been apart of the household norm. My older brother used to work for a video game store, so we got
        to "test" a variety of consoles and games growing up. Although today, I'm not super big on video games. </p>
      <p class="lrgft">Now-a-days I prefer spending my time away from the computer in the outdoors. I enjoy streneous hikes
        and long trips into the wilderness. I also like to travel and I've been to a whole bunch of places. Not really big
        on sports, but basketball is cool, so is rugby.</p>
      <p class="lrgft">I'm excited to become an expert developer in the next few years. Something I've always been interested
        in is problem solving daily issues with software. I have tons of ideas and I'm ready to bring them into reality.
